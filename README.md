# Final Year Project: Human Computer Interface HCI using EEG signals.
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is one type of Human Computer Interface, and it basically means a type of channel which allows the users to control the user interface or external devices, by the means of using embedding (invasive) or wearing (non-invasive) devices to detect brainwave signals or electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.

### Controlling cursors by using Emotiv INSIGHT headgear ###

### Explanation of application
It could be difficult to understand the meaning behind each signal by simply looking or observing the signals in software. Therefore, a Python program has been built to process the data. The mental commands were calibrated and set previously by wearing the headset. The mental commands werre stored in each personâ€™s training profile and updated to WebSocket server which is a server storing the data that is corresponding to each command. On Windows, Cortex Service could be regarded as a WebSocket server that uses the JSON-RPC protocol which is a means of communication between the Python program and the WebSocket Server. The WebSocket server sends the commands in response to the data back to the Python program, and the Python program that has imported PyAutoGUI will control and manage cursor input and perform the commands on Monitor. A conceptual diagram has been shown in Figure 1 too.

### Explanation of Repository

* **cortex.py** contains a set of pre-defined functions provided by cortex developer guide, besides cortex credential.
* **cursor_control.py** contains the executable program, besides cortex credential
* **Figure 1.png** contains a graphical explanation of how the program works.
* **pyautogui_test.py** is a testing script for author to understand how to use pyautogui library.
* **Figure 2.png** contains screen shot of the training profile and the Python program.

### Solution of some of the potential errors may occur:
1. Error: Did not find expected keys in client_id file D:\User\Desktop\cortex_creds.txt  or  OSError: no such file: D:\User\Desktop\cortex_creds.txt
   Solution: Parse a client_id file for client_id and client secret. We expect the client_id file to have the format:
            
            # optional comments start with hash
            client_id Jj2R3827GyABCxyz......
            client_secret abcdefghijJKLMNABCxyz......

2. Error: Modulenotfounderror: "No module named websockets" 
   Solution: Install the websockets package in python. Google it if not familar with python install package process.

3. Error: Invalid Profile Name
   Solution: This is due to that I changed the predefined function "load_profile" in cortex.py. To fix the error, open cortex.py and find where the function is declared, change '1stTry' in params to your own profile name. Your profile name can be found in the EmotivBCI app.
	
### Note from Author
This project idea is inspired by the work from https://github.com/kevinjycui/EEG-Cursor-Control and https://github.com/SiwenW/EMOTIV-INSIGHT-EEG-CURSOR-CONTROL
I got lots of help by looking at their codes and explanation: https://medium.com/@kevinjycui/of-mice-and-mind-creating-a-simple-eeg-cursor-control-application-7fcdad703d2f
